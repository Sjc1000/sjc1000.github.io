                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Steven, I live in Australia. I like to drink booze and write code! 
                <br><br>I have been coding since I was 16, I started with a simple language called <a href="http://autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a>, A language to easily bind hotkeys or make simple GUI programs.
                <br>Since then I've moved into languages like Python, tinkered with C/C++. Played with lua so I could make some nice <a href="https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky">conky</a> configs for myself, learnt bash so I could operate my Linux computer better, Decent with HTML / CSS / JS, this website was made from scratch!
                <br><br>I usually hang out on IRC, where I've made some friends, we mainly discuss programming related topics and other useful things. I have been a helper in the AutoHotkey chat for years, Joined the <a href="http://donationcoder.com/">Donation Coder</a> chat and have participated in a few of their events, such as their <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?board=325.0">New Apps For the New Year</a>.
                <br><br>Thesedays I mainly use Python, creating simple programs that make my day to day life easier, from keeping an eye on certain YouTube users to downloading stuff at night while I sleep. If I need to automate it Python is where I go.</p>
